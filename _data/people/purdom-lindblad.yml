bio: 'The Scholars'' Lab fosters a vibrant <a href="/people">graduate community</a>,
  rich with alumni, current fellows, student assistants, and fellow travelers. As
  the Head of Graduate Programs, I coordinate our two <a href="/graduate-fellowships">fellowship
  programs</a>, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities and our innovative <a
  href="www.praxis.scholarslab.org">Praxis Program</a>. In addition, I work with the
  international <a href="www.praxis-network.org">Praxis Network</a>, which showcases
  new models of humanities methods training.


  I have a background in Religious Studies, American Studies, and Information Science.
  Currently, I am exploring <a href="www.ivanhoe.scholarslab.org">Ivanhoe</a> and
  our new MakerSpace, with a special focus on wearable computing.'
