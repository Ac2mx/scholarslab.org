bio: Bluegrass music in the Czech Republic -- there's a lot of it, and there's a lot
  of history and variety to the music-making. In addition to participant-observation
  and other person-level ethnographic work with folks who are part of the Czech bluegrass
  community, I broaden my work through web-based interactions. My online "Bluegrassová
  Mapa Ceské Republiky," which is in construction with help from the UVA library and
  the <a href="http://www.bacr.cz/english.php">Bluegrassova Asociace Ceske Republiky</a>
  will help widen the perspective of my dissertation, indicate the extent of bluegrass
  activity in Czech Republic to outsiders, and enable new local community and inter-community
  connections.
