bio: 'As Design Architect, I focus on front-end development, user interface, user
  experience, and aesthetics for Scholars'' Lab projects, but I know enough programming
  to cause trouble for the folks in R&amp;D. In addition to helping faculty and students
  on their research projects, I keep office hours and do research and teaching for
  our <a title="Makerspace" href="http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/">Makerspace</a>.
  I''m currently researching methods for doing distant reading of comic books using
  computer vision.


  I''ve been a practicing digital humanist for a little over a decade now. I have
  a Master''s degree in History, and have taught courses in history, graphic design,
  new media, and American studies. I''m also an instructor at <a href="http://www.dhtraining.org/hilt/"><abbr
  title="Humanities Intensive Learning and Teaching">HILT</abbr></a> and <a href="http://www.accessiblefuture.org/">Accessible
  Future</a>. I serve as the Communication Officer for the <a href="http://ach.org">Association
  for Computers and the Humanities</a>.
