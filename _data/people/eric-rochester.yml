bio: 'My interests include text processing, text mining, and natural language processing,
  as well as web-development and general programming.


  Studied medieval English literature and linguistics at <a href="http://www.english.uga.edu/">UGA</a>.
  Dissertated on lexicography. Now I program in Haskell and write when I''m not building
  cool stuff for the Scholars'' Lab. Also, husband and parent. Do you notice that
  <em>sleep</em> isn''t on that list?'
