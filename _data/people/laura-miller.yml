bio: 'The Scholars'' Lab supports a diverse community of digital scholars and scholarly
  makers across the University and beyond. As Head of Public Programs, my main goal
  is to foster and grow that community. I convene our <a href="http://scholarslab.org/events/">speaker
  events and workshops</a>, designed to connect researchers - at all levels - with
  expertise, training, and intellectual discourse.  I also manage our <a href="http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/">Makerspace</a>
  and serve as the primary point of contact between the Scholars’ Lab and broader
  library services.


  I have a background in English and information science, was the librarian on the
  Fall 2015 voyage of <a href="http://www.semesteratsea.org/">Semester at Sea</a>,
  and have an ongoing interest in digital publishing and open scholarly communication.
