Anthony is a rising senior in Linguistics and Communications at the [University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras campus](http://www.uprrp.edu).  Among the myriad of subjects he is passionate about, Gender Studies is at the top of his list.  He, like many other 21-year-olds, is solely in the search of discovering who he wants to be for the remainder of his life.
