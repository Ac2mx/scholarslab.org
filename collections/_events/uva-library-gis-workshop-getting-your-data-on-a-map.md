Do you have GPS points or a list of latitude and longitude you would like to show as points on a map?  This session will show you how to turn your data into map layers and how to connect them to make lines and polygons as well.

All sessions are one hour and assume attendees have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials with expert assistance. All sessions will be taught in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421 (adjacent to the Scholarsâ€™ Lab) and are free to attend and are open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
