title: 'Makerspace Workshop: Making Your First 3D Model'
---

This workshop introduces software, hardware, and techniques for creating a simple 3D model from an existing object. We’ll cover various ways of creating 3D models, demonstrate laser scanning with a Kinect and photogrammetry using a digital camera. We’ll spend most of the class capturing a model using photogrammetry, and if all goes well, you’ll leave the workshop with your own 3D model to embed on a web page, or edit to make a 3D print using our lab’s Makerbot. If you’d like to be a participant and not a spectator, bring a laptop and camera. (Cell phone cameras are fine!)
