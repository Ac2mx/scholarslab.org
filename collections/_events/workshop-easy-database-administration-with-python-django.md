title: 'Workshop: Easy Database Administration with Python & Django'
---

What do you do when your data outgrows Excel? This happens on most projects, but moving to a full database can seem daunting. But the web framework Django can make this much easier. This workshop will talk about when you may need to transition out of Excel, what you gain by moving to a database, how to change the way you think about your data as you move to a Django site, and how to setup a simple Django site for managing your database and the data in it.

To get the most out of this workshop, youâ€™ll want to be comfortable working on the command line, and a passing familiarity with Python will be helpful also. Come by and talk to us beforehand if you have any questions about this.
