**Getting Your Data on a Map**

Do you have a list of Lat/Lon coordinates or addresses you would like to see on a map?  We will show you how to do just that.  Through ArcGIS’s Add XY data tool and Geocoding (address matching), it is easy to take your tabular lists and generate points on a map.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be held on **Tuesdays from 3PM to 4PM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.  No registration, just show up!
