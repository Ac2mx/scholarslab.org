Using [Neatline](http://neatline.org/), anyone can create beautiful, interactive maps, timelines, and narrative sequences from collections of archives and artifacts, telling scholarly stories in a whole new way. Join us for this hands-on introduction to Neatline. See [http://neatline.org/](http://neatline.org/) for more information.

Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials, and assume no previous experience. All sessions will be taught in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421 (adjacent to the Scholarsâ€™ Lab) and are free to attend and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
