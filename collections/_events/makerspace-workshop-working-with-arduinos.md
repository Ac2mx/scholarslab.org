New to microcontrollers? Or used an Arduino before and want more time to play in a supportive environment? Come on by! [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) is a tool for making microcomputers that can sense and control the physical world. This workshop will introduce participants to the basics of physical computing and programming through a series of hands-on exercises using our Arduino kits. This workshop builds on the Working with Arduino I and II workshops, but they’re not required to attend this one.

If you can't make this session but would like to learn more about Arduino boards and shields, please visit the student consultants in our [Makerspace](http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/) or email [scholarslab@virginia.edu](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) to set up an individual appointment.
