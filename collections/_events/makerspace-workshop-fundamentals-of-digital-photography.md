Turn your camera's mode dial off of Auto and learn the basics of digital photography. We'll cover the basic components of exposure, depth of field, focal length and perspective, and color. This workshop will be most applicable to SLR, mirrorless, and advanced point-and-shoot cameras with manual operation modes, but many concepts will also be useful for basic point-and-shoot and cell phone cameras.
_Instructor: [Shane Lin](http://scholarslab.org/people/shane-lin/)_

_Scholars' Lab workshops assume attendees have no previous experience. They will be hands-on with with expert assistance.Â  All are free to attend, and they are open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community._
