title: Visual Thinking Workshop with Nick Sousanis
---

Join Nick Sousanis, comics creator and professor, for an interactive workshop that explores how comics can enrich your own critical practice through visual thinking. Participants will do drawing and cartooning activities that can be adapted in their scholarship and teaching practices.Â  Learn how to make comics and explore your own creativity! (No prior drawing experience required.)

**Nick Sousanis** is a professor in Humanities & Liberal Studies at San Francisco State University, where he is starting an interdisciplinary Comics Studies program. His doctoral dissertation, Unflattening, written and drawn entirely in comic form, was published by Harvard University Press in 2015.
