[Omeka](http://omeka.org/) is a simple, free, web publishing system developed at the Roy Rosensweig Center for History and New Media at GMU. It was specifically built to enable scholars, archives, libraries, museums, and independent researchers to create online exhibits of their work without having to know HTML or CSS. If you have a collections of digital resources that you want to show in a scholarly way, Omeka could be a great tool to have in your toolkit.

Our sessions assume attendees have no previous experience, and will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials with expert assistance. All sessions will be taught in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421 (adjacent to the Scholarsâ€™ Lab) and are free to attend and are open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.
