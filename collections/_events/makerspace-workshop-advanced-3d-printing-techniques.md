We'll discuss advanced slicer settings and model manipulations to work around tricky printing situations, printer maintenance and troubleshooting, experimental filaments, and post-print finishing techniques. This workshop is intended for those with some experience with 3D printing or have joined us for our Introduction to 3D Printing.  











Instructor: [Shane Lin](http://scholarslab.org/people/shane-lin/) and [Julia Schrank](http://scholarslab.org/people/julia-schrank/)
