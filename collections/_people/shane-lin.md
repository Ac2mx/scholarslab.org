Shane works on the history of computing and the impact of digital technology on culture and politics. His dissertation, "Kingdom of Code: Cryptography and the New Privacy" tracks the development of civilian encryption technology and the emergence of cryptography as an academic field of study, the debates over crypto regulation, and the concomitant construction of a new, far more expansive notion of privacy from 1975 to 2000.  As part of his fellowship, Shane will build software tools to analyze a large collection of Usenet posts relating to cryptography in order to uncover the flows of influence between users and across subject domains.
