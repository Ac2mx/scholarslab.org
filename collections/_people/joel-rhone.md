An English major at Howard University, Joel studies literature after WWII. His focus is on how militaristic narratives and ideology construct civilian reality.  Joel’s favorite books and movies include _A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Go Tell It On the Mountain, It’s Kind of a Funny Story, and The Adjustment Bureau_. He also loves plays, ice cream, and board games.
