The Classroom is a flexible learning space shared by the Scholars' Lab and other Library units, providing space for library-related instruction, workshops, invited speakers, and special events. Scholars' Lab workshops and the speaker series are often held in this room. Please note that overhead air vents in middle of room mean a mic is required for folks in the back half of the room to hear presenters well. **When not otherwise reserved, this room is available for use as open study space, with seating for 30 people at chairs and tables. Check the schedule on the door for times when the room is unavailable.**
