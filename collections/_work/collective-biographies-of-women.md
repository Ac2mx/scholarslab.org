Alison Booth’s [Collective Biographies of Women](http://womensbios.lib.virginia.edu/about) began as a simple electronic text which, in collaboration with the Scholars’ Lab, blossomed into a rich instrument for the study of prosopography. Professor Booth has been selected as an [IATH](http://iath.virginia.edu/) and [ACLS Fellow](http://www.acls.org/research/digital.aspx?id=798) on the merit of this work.
