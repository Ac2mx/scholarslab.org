The website [ScholarsLab.org](http://scholarslab.org) contains the collective effort of our [staff and collaborators](/people), past and present. The website has existed in multiple forms: most recently, as a WordPress site and now, as of this blog post, as a Jekyll-generated static website.

# Why renew the website?
Our previous website was headed by the homepage text "collaborate, **iterate**, discuss":

We're a community lab focused on experimental scholarship. We care most about the impact of scholarship on *people*, ranking positive human experience as the most important outcome of projects or other work. This means that failure and a journey of many iterations are not just frequent by-products of our work, but essential characteristics. For example, we periodically renew our [lab charter](/charter) to reflect our ongoing growth as scholars and professionals; as it was last updated in 2016, we'll be renewing its text (and even, perhaps, its form) over the coming year.

Before renewing our charter, though, we worked on synthesizing our many views of what the lab currently is into a coherent, concise missionâ€“visible at the top of our new homepage. Having the website look "newer" wasn't a priority for us; rather, we used this re-articulated mission to reimagine a site more aligned with our values...

# Why does the site look this way?
Started as renew to fit mission + Jekyll vs. WordPress (minimal, less sysadmin, more enfranchised)
Iterated to audience as those who wouldn't otherwise already know about or feel welcome to join us, align with "people over projects" and emphasize community over center (you are part of us)
Welcome, encourage: text, inventories categorized (e.g. sewing) so can tell what they're for, maps with spaces labeled
Avoid typical DH/tech/code visual tropes
Make info easier to find: FAQ, info restructure (menu, pages, layout/order per page) 
Capture the current SLab (DH/DS, all current staff)
Show our being part of the Library

# Who made this?
The 2017-2018 renewal of this website incorporates text, suggestions, and feedback from everyone on [the Scholars' Lab staff](/people). Additionally, the following folks put in significant extra effort on the site's design, coding, content, project management, and documentation: Katherine Donnally, Jeremy Boggs, Brandon Walsh, Ronda Grizzle, Laura Miller, Zoe LeBlanc, Ammon Shepherd, Shane Lin, Beth Mitchell, and Amanda Visconti.

We want to especially highlight the leadership and labor of [Katherine Donnally](/people/katherine-donnally/) (Scholars' Lab DH Designer 2017-2018) in realizing this site. Katherine's thinking and work gave the renewal project a coherent focus around making the lab more accessible and supportive of folks who might not otherwise feel part of our community; in addition to design and development work, she created structures and documentation (e.g. goal and progress tracker, code commenting, analysis of the old website, articulation of the purpose of the new site) that were instrumental in both imagining the new site and seeing it to the finish line.
