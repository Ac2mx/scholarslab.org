The website [ScholarsLab.org](http://scholarslab.org) contains the collective effort of our [staff and collaborators](/people), past and present. The website has existed in multiple forms: most recently, as a WordPress site and now, as of this blog post, as a Jekyll-generated static website.

# Why renew the website?
Our previous website proclaimed at the top of the homepage: "collaborate, **iterate**, discuss".

We're a lab focused on experimental scholarship. We care more about the impact of scholarship on *people* than we do the projects we collaborate on (though those are pretty important, too). This means that accepting failure and a journey of many iterations is not just a by-product of our work, but essential to our goals. For example, we periodically renew our [lab charter](/charter), too;  as it was last updated in 2016 before some of our current staff arrived—and two years back in the experiences of all our staff—we'll be renewing that soon, too.

[something something specific goals, not just newer look]

# Goals of the new site
Welcome, encourage  
Make info easier to find  
Rethink how we communicate, concisely, what we do  
Capture the current SLab (DH/DS, all current staff)
Show our being part of the Library

Examples:
colors & font
map with color-coded areas
equipment categories (e.g. sewing) so can tell what they're for
welcome, encouragement
audience as those who wouldn't otherwise already know about or feel welcome to join us
community over center

# Who made this?
The 2017-2018 renewal of this website incorporates text, suggestions, and feedback from everyone on [the Scholars' Lab staff](/people). Additionally, the following folks put in significant extra effort on the site's design, coding, content, project management, and documentation: Katherine Donnally, Jeremy Boggs, Brandon Walsh, Ronda Grizzle, Laura Miller, Zoe LeBlanc, Ammon Shepherd, Shane Lin, Beth Mitchell, and Amanda Visconti.

We want to especially highlight the leadership and labor of [Katherine Donnally](/people/katherine-donnally/) (Scholars' Lab DH Designer 2017-2018) in realizing this site. Katherine's thinking and work gave the renewal project a coherent focus around making the lab more accessible and supportive of folks who might not otherwise feel part of our community; in addition to design and development work, she created structures and documentation (e.g. goal and progress tracker, code commenting, analysis of the old website, articulation of the purpose of the new site) that were instrumental in both imagining the new site and seeing it to the finish line.
