This website contains the collective effort of our [staff and collaborators](/people), past and present. The website has existed in multiple forms: most recently, as a WordPress site (?-2018) and now a Jekyll-generated static website (2018-current).

**The 2017-2018 renewal of this website** incorporates text, suggestions, and feedback from everyone on [the Scholars' Lab staff](/people). Additionally, the following folks put in significant extra effort on the site's design, coding, content, project management, and documentation: Katherine Donnally, Jeremy Boggs, Brandon Walsh, Ronda Grizzle, Laura Miller, Zoe LeBlanc, Ammon Shepherd, Shane Lin, Beth Mitchell, and Amanda Visconti.

We want to especially highlight the leadership and labor of [Katherine Donnally](/people/katherine-donnally/) (Scholars' Lab DH Designer 2017-2018) in realizing this site. Katherine's thinking and work gave the renewal project a coherent focus around making the lab more accessible and supportive of folks who might not otherwise feel part of our community; in addition to design and development work, she created structures and documentation (e.g. goal and progress tracker, code commenting, analysis of the old website, articulation of the purpose of the new site) that were instrumental in both imagining the new site and seeing it to the finish line.

Check out our [site relaunch blog post]() for more information on how and why we renewed the ScholarsLab.org website. You may also be interested in the [site map](/sitemap) listing all of this website's pages.
