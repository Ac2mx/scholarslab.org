At the Scholars' Lab, our most important project is nurturing our community of scholars: mentors, learners, researchers, teachers, crafters and makers, and collaborators. The Scholars' Lab is part of [University of Virginia Library](http://library.virginia.edu/), and we regularly collaborate with UVA students and faculty from across the disciplines, in addition to our UVA Library colleagues. 

Our highly-trained [faculty and staff](http://www.scholarslab.org/people/) are scholar-practitioners with special expertise in the **experimental** and **digital humanities**, including **spatial technologies**, **scholarly making and building**, **cultural heritage informatucs**, **pedagogy**, and other scholarship at the intersection of the digital and cultural. Students and researchers from across the disciplines can visit the us to collaborate on digital projects and benefit from expert consultation and teaching. 

The SLab hosts [events](http://www.scholarslab.org/events/) (like workshops and a popular lecture series), and helps to train and mentor the next generation of digital humanities scholar-practitioners through our [Graduate Fellowships in Digital Humanities](http://www.scholarslab.org/graduate-fellowships/) and innovative [Praxis Program](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/). We are a founding member of [centerNet](http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/), a worldwide alliance of digital humanities centers, and of the international [Praxis Network](http://praxis-network.org/), which takes its name from our fellowship program here at UVa.
