		<div class="spatial-inclusion__text">
			<p>This text is separate and apart from the blurbs up top explaining what Spatial Tech does and what methods they use to do it. This is a space to explicitly indicate that Spatial Tech is <em>not</em> a boys' club for flying drones, or outdoorsy people, or people who already know how to use ArcGIS and what "photogrammetry" means.</p>
			<p>This text is necessary here just as it is necessary in the Makerspace page&mdash;women, people of color, and other marginalized groups are much less likely to have had ambient exposure to these types of tools; and much less likely to have been encouraged to keep trying if they didn't get it perfectly the first time. This is a space for learning and curiosity; not for making judgments about groups. A primary mission of Spatial Technologies in the Scholars' Lab is to highlight systemic, endemic injustices rendered invisible by decisions to exclude whole groups from dignified historical record. We need your skills, questions, and backgrounds to succeed, and hope you'll join us.</p>
