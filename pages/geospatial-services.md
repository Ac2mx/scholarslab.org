Our expert staff supports application of GIS and mapping technologies across the disciplines. We also provide consultation on data and software for research and classroom use.


## Getting started with GIS


Need help finding data, getting it on a map, or downloading the newest version of ArcGIS?  Check the FAQ's on the [GIS research page](http://guides.lib.virginia.edu/gis), search the [UVA Library Geoportal](http://gis.lib.virginia.edu/), or come to a session in our Fall or Spring [workshop series](http://www.scholarslab.org/events/).   You can also consult directly with GIS specialist Chris Gist.  If you have questions or would like to schedule an appointment, please contact [slabgis@virginia.edu](mailto:slabgis@virginia.edu).


## Geospatial Research Projects


With the support of the NEH and Library of Congress and in collaboration with the creators of [Omeka](http://omeka.org), we made [Neatline](http://neatline.org), a major contribution to spatial and temporal annotation and storytelling in the humanities.  In order to spark the "spatial humanities" in the United States, in 2011, we also hosted [GeoInst](http://spatial.scholarslab.org/), a 2-year NEH-funded workshop for librarians, scholars, and technologists. See more of our spatial humanities and GIS projects done in collaboration with UVa faculty on our [Research page](http://scholarslab.org/research/).
