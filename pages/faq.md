# How does the Lab fit into the UVA Library?
We’re part of the UVA Library’s mission to provide equitable access to knowledge and learning to everyone.

# "Other forms of scholarship"? I thought scholarship = research?
We believe

# I've heard that "people over projects" is a Scholars' Lab motto. What does that mean? Do you do projects?
At the Scholars' Lab, our most important digital humanities project is our community of scholars: mentors, learners, researchers, teachers, crafters & makers, collaborators.

# How can the Scholars' Lab fit into my work?
1. **Consults**: As a Library unit, we follow the model of reference librarian consultations and welcome everyone in the UVA community to meet with us for a brief consultation session around experimental and/or digital approaches to humanities and culture. During your consult, we can help you get started in DH, conceptualize a project, use some of our scholarly equipment (e.g. GIS software, humanities-focused Makerspace, 3D scanning/photogrammetry, VR/AR), and/or connect you to resources for self-teaching and networking at UVA and internationally.
2. **Collaboration**: As scholars in the experimental and digital humanities, we also have (limited availability for more in-depth research or pedagogical collaborations with other UVA scholars:
  - We enjoy building things _with_ people (e.g. as peer scholars and co-PIs on grant proposals), but we do not build things _for_ people. Our decisions about longer-term research collaboration are based on the resources, skills, and interests/mission of all parties.
  - We do our best to help out folks stuck on a DH technical question during our regular Open Office Hours, and are happy to refer to expertise and facilities around the University (e.g. Data Sciences Institute, SHANTI, IATH).  In general we do not provide design, web development, or technical support.
  - Our team consists of folks with years of scholarly experience and/or graduate degrees. With at least a semester's notice we might collaborate on syllabus design, and after longer relationships collaborate on formal course co-teaching. 
  - Faculty who seek support for digital assignments in their courses or short-term tech instruction should begin with their subject librarian, well in advance. They can additionally connect you with the Library's experts in copyright, data organization (metadata), digital project preservation, research data, and teaching and learning. We recommend consultation with the A&S Learning Design and Technology staff.
3. **The scholarship of service**: Most of our time for in-depth work and collaboration is allotted to:
  - Our 20 graduate and undergraduate fellows and 10 student research assistants, as the scholarship of DH mentoring and teaching
  - Internal research supporting DH scholarship, such as building our Neatline tool for critical storytelling in time and space
  - Collaborations with other UVA Library colleagues toward supporting the Library's mission (e.g. piloting future library digital services, building websites to preserve the record of major campus events)
  - We publicize other opportunities through a [newsletter]. We bring DH speakers to Grounds and host DH events, teach workshop series, sponsor student- and faculty-run events, teach workshops, and hold regular Open Office Hours anyone can join.

# Can you build me a thing?
In general, we do not provide design, web development, or technical support. We enjoy building things _with_ people (e.g. as peer scholars and co-PIs on grant proposals), but we do not build things _for_ people. We do our best to help out folks stuck on a DH technical question during our regular Open Office Hours, and are happy to refer to expertise and facilities around the University (e.g. Data Sciences Institute, SHANTI, IATH).  

# Can we collaborate?
Our decisions about longer-term research collaboration are based on the resources, skills, and interests/mission of all parties. [Contact us](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) for an initial consult to discuss ideas for longer-term collaborations, such as working as co-PIs on a grant project.

# Where are you?
Our [hours-and-spaces](Hours & Spaces page) has more information on our physical spaces as well as maps helping you navigate to us. 

We're in Alderman Library, which is just west of the Rotunda and chapel and east of Nameless Field on UVA Grounds. We're the west wing of Alderman's fourth floor, but because the main public entrance to Alderman opens onto the 4th floor we're on the same floor you enter on. Turn left and walk past Greenberry's coffee shop and a water fountain to find the Scholars' Lab staff offices, then turn right to find our Common Area and Makerspace.

Our cultural heritage informatics experts, Will Rourk and Arin Bennett, are currently seated on the third floor of Clemons Library, which is right next to Alderman to the southwest (turn right after entering the 3rd floor, and walk past the open lab area to find their offices). The Clemons VizLounge spaces is also on the third floor, but you'd reach it by turning left after entering the third floor.
