We're part of the UVA Library's mission to provide equitable access to learning to everyone, and we're proud that librarian superpowers are part of our toolkit! We frequently collaborate with and rely on our colleagues in the Library.

Some of these folks don't work directly with students, staff, or faculty outside the Library, but they're critical to everything we do. These colleagues include Guy Mengel's team housekeeping and securing our spaces, Stephanie Crooks for assisting with events logistics, and Robin Ruggaber's team for IT and UX support. Phylissa Mitchell keeps our library's focus on inclusion, diversity, and equity. Dave Hennigan helps us design and manage grant-supported scholarship.

We're also grateful for the frequent collaborators with us in the Library Public Services unit (Barbie Selby's Info Services team, Meridith Wolnick's Teaching & Learning team, Christine Ruotolo's Arts & Humanities team, Michele Claibourn's Research Data Services team).

Check back on this page soon to read the stories of some of our specific intra-Library collaborations!
