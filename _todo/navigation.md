layout: page
title: Navigation
status: it <em>exists</em> but I am not in love with it
phase: 1
time-required: medium-rare
notes:
- Time increases to ~medium-well~ if include a separate one for homepage (see below), which may not be possible by April 30.
- Paste in JavaScript from patterns repo that makes # links displayed recalculate based on viewport size (hides rest in sub-menu)
- Tweak JS so it's properly selecting elements in our document
- Finalize list of links and in what order
- NB: want to order links from most-to-least important because the first couple of links will show no matter what size the viewport width is, and the most obscure ones will only show at very large widths
- Also, want to make a different one for Home and other pages with dramatic landing page - top bar takes away from the design, but something def should be there. The Huge Inc. model works nicely.
- Any other navigation stuff is probably Phase II, and homepage one might be Phase II
