title: 'Synthesize GIS & AR/VR into Spatial Technologies'
phase: 1
time-required: large
notes:
- Spatial Tech blurb in Beth's Google Doc
- Cultural Heritage site contains VR/AR descriptions
- GIS page on current site contains GIS descriptions
- Phase I content: who works there, what they do, what Spatial Tech is, link to the CHI page, link to the GIS page
- Will GIS and AR/VR continue to independently exist as URLs or eventually do we want to phase that out? (Kind of a Phase II question)
