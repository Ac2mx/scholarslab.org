## Hours


**We are staffed most weekdays during the semester and summer sessions.  See our up-to-date schedule on [the Library's hours page](http://cal.lib.virginia.edu/hours/).
**


## Ethos


The Scholars' Lab Makerspace is a place for tinkering and experimentation with technologies like desktop fabrication, physical computing, and augmented reality. Open to everyone, we specialize in applications and research questions in the humanities and arts.

Informed by a rich tradition of Library support for exploring materiality in [Special Collections](http://smallnotes.library.virginia.edu/) and the Fine Arts Library [Materials Collection](http://uvamagazine.org/articles/the_tactile_library), and for participating in the physical-made-digital in both the [Scholars' Lab](http://scholarslab.org/) and the [Digital Media Lab](http://www.library.virginia.edu/blog/libraries/dml/) in Clemons, our Makerspace Technologists can help faculty and student researchers evaluate new approaches to their work, and consider both the hows and the whys of making.

Learning _how_ to do something with humanities technology gives us a more informed perspective on _why_ we do things in the humanities. **Both are vital.**

## Using the Makerspace


Interested in exploring the Makerspace?  Have an idea to use microcontrollers or 3D modeling and printing technology to enhance your research or differently interrogate your assumptions?  **The Makerspace is open from 1:00-7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 1:00-5:00 p.m. on Friday**.  Check out our printer availability on our [printer calendar](http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/makerspace-3d-printer-calendar/). Stop by to talk to one of our Technologists, attend our maker [workshops](http://www.scholarslab.org/events/), or contact us at [slabmakerspace@virginia.edu](mailto:slabmakerspace@virginia.edu) to schedule an appointment with a Makerspace Technologist or Scholars' Lab staff to discuss your planned project.
