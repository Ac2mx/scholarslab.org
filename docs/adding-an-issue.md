# What's an issue?

An **issue** (aka ticket) is how GitHub lets us make a note about a bug we've identified and need to fix, a feature request, ideas for future site features, and similar tasks. If you have something you want someone (or yourself) to fix, or an idea for future work on the site, issues keep track and help us prioritize this work.

We try to  
* keep these to single tasks when possible (one task per issue), or use checklists if an issue has multiple steps (checklists use this markdown: `- [ ]` for incomplete steps or `- [x]` for completed steps)  
* include enough info so anyone on the team can address the issue  
* add a few pieces of metadata to each issue: ID if a specific person needs to address the issue  
* label what kind of work it requires, if known (e.g. fixing a bug, content writing/editing, design/development work, documentation writing)  
* attach the issue to a "milestone" to signal when it needs to get done (milestone = way of gathering multiple issues under a lbale, and setting a deadline on addressing them; e.g. "Stuff to fix before annoucing the new website" (due January 15, 2019), "Stuff to get done during Spring 2019", and "Rainy Day" for stuff that isn't urgent)

An "open" issue is one that hasn't been completed; a "closed" issue has been completed.

You can view the [list of all open SLab.org issues](https://github.com/scholarslab/scholarslab.org/issues), or simply click the "Issues" tab at the top-left of the repo:

# Looking at existing issues
The [main issues page](https://github.com/scholarslab/scholarslab.org/issues) for this repo looks something like this:  
![https://github.com/scholarslab/scholarslab.org/blob/master/docs/docs-images/docs-issues-overview-top.png]()
* On the left, the filter field shows you which (if any) filters are on. If you've applied a filter to which issues are displayed (e.g. only show issues assigned to no one), it will appear here (so check here if you're not seeing an issue you think exists, because it could be hidden by filtering)  
* The "Labels" and "Milestones" buttons in the top middle of the page take you to  
  1) a page listing this repo's existing labels for organizing issues (you can add additional labels there, or see how many issues have a specific label applied to them), and  
  2) a page listing the repo's existing milestones (with description of what each milestone is for, % of milestone completed, due date; and you can also create new milestones there)  
* To the right, an array of filters let you change which of all the repo's issues are displayed. You can apply multiple filters at the same time (e.g. only issues due in our "before announcing site" milestone with no one assigned to take care of them). The most useful filters are:   
  * Labels (e.g. see only content or documentation issues)  
  * Milestone (e.g. see only issues attached to our "before announcing site" milestone)  
  * Assignee (e.g. see only issues with no assigned to take care of them, or only issues assigned to you)   
* On the far right, the "New issue" button (for creating new issues)  

Looking below these options, you'll see:  
![https://github.com/scholarslab/scholarslab.org/blob/master/docs/docs-images/docs-issues-overview-bottom.png]()  
* On the left, you can select-all or check off multiple issues; the filter options on the upper right change when you've selected issues to allow you to bulk mark an issue closed or bulk-change the label(s), milestone, or assignee(s)  
* Avatars of folks assigned to work on an issue appear on the right of each issue
* Colored labels appear on the nearer right of each issue
