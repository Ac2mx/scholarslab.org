# General tips  
- Don't add Open Office Hours as an event; this is already stickied on the front page at the bottom of the upcoming events, with "each week" instead of a specific date.
  - (I'll add an issue to pull this out into an /_include file like the homepage snowstorm alert, so it's easier to alter if we're going to not hold Open Office Hours one week or if it's summer.)
