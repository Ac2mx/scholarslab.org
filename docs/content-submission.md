# Contributing Written Content

## What this page covers:

* This guide discusses the submission of language edits or creation on *non-repeating* pages. For routine submission of blog posts and other repeating content, please see "Managing Site Content" in our [main README](https://github.com/scholarslab/scholarslab.org/blob/master/README.md).
	* Non-repeating pages include: Home, Makerspace, Praxis, etc.

* This process should be roughly the same for *pre-existing pages* whose content changes significantly (e.g. Home) and *newly-created pages* whose content will be constructed from scratch (e.g. Origin Stories).
