This tutorial covers authoring and editing new pages and posts in detail. You can instead jump to a [concise set of steps] once you've read the detailed version once.

There are **two big steps** to authoring/editing on our website:
1. Create a new "branch" and do your authoring/editing there—[instructions on Step 1]
2. Move that work back to the main repo (aka master branch) so it shows up on [maybe.scholarslab.org](http://maybe.scholarslab.org)—[instructions on Step 2]  
*3rd step, coming soon!* on how to move this work from the development site to the production (public) site.

# 1. Do your writing!
## Add new content

### Add a new page

### Add a new blog post

## Edit existing content

### Embedding media (photos, GIFs, videos...)

# 2. Move your writing to the main repo!

Watch out—the page might initially show you there are no conflicts and it's okay to press that green merge button. But wait! There's one set of checks that won't appear for a few extra seconds than you'd probably think to wait before merging—up to a slow count of 30. Watch this GIF to know what to expect:
