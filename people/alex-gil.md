Textual critic, high theory acolyte, archive rat, hard-hat Caribbeanist, Rails aficionado, conference-trotter. My thesis focuses on the evolution of the play _Et les chiens se taisaient_ by Aimé Césaire. Other projects include: an edition of Césaire, [THATCampCaribe](http://caribbean2012.thatcamp.org/), a better [Juxta](http://www.juxtasoftware.org/), a class on [#critcode](http://www.elotroalex.com/teaching/spring-2012/mdst-3559/), and Prism at the [Praxis Program](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/).
