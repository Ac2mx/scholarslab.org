In brief: I am an Early American historian, a database designer, and a photographer. I'm also sleep-deprived, but that probably isn't related . . . 

Current Digital Humanities Librarian at Brown University, former Presidential Fellow in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, a former Digital Humanities Fellow in the University of Virginia Library's Digital Scholars' Lab, and a former a NINES Graduate Fellow.
