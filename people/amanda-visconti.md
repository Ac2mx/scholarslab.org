Amanda Visconti is Managing Director of the Scholars' Lab. She holds a Literature Ph.D. from the University of Maryland and an M.S. in Information from the University of Michigan, and is also a web developer with 10 years of experience.

She serves as an elected member of the [Association for Computing and the Humanities](http://ach.org) (ACH) executive council, as a member of the [Modern Languages Association](http://mla.org) (MLA) Information Technology Committee, and as the administrator of the [Digital Humanities Slack](http://tinyurl.com/DHSlack).

Her 2015 dissertation ([Dr.AmandaVisconti.com](http://Dr.AmandaVisconti.com)) was the first humanities dissertation to fully acknowledge digital methods (code, design, user testing, blogging, no chapters) as scholarship by treating them *as* the dissertation instead of addenda to traditional written chapters. The focus of her dissertation was creating the participatory digital edition of James Joyce's _Ulysses_ [InfiniteUlysses.com](http://InfiniteUlysses.com), which attracted over 12,000 unique visitors in its first few weeks of open beta and was cited in _The New York Times_ in July 2016.
