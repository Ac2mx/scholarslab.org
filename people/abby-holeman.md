Research Assistant in the UVa Department of Anthropology, former Scholars' Lab Fellow. Her research interests include the intersection of cosmology and social organization at the site of Paquimé, to assess the nature of hierarchy and social differentiation in non-state societies, and exploring new ways to understand meaning in the archaeological record through symbolic and spatial analyses.
