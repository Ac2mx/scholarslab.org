At the [University of Virginia Library](http://library.virginia.edu/) Scholarsâ€™ Lab, advanced students and researchers from across the disciplines partner on digital projects and benefit from expert consultation and teaching. Our highly-trained [faculty and staff](http://www.scholarslab.org/people/) focus especially on the **digital humanities**, **geospatial information**, and **scholarly making and building** at the intersection of our digital and physical worlds.

The SLab hosts [events](http://www.scholarslab.org/events/) (like workshops and a popular lecture series), and helps to train and mentor the next generation of digital humanities scholar-practitioners through our [Graduate Fellowships in Digital Humanities](http://www.scholarslab.org/graduate-fellowships/) and innovative [Praxis Program](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/). We are a founding member of [centerNet](http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/), a worldwide alliance of digital humanities centers, and of the international [Praxis Network](http://praxis-network.org/), which takes its name from our fellowship program here at UVa.
