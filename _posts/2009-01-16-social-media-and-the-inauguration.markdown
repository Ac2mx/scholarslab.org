![Social Media in the SLab](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3525/3202007970_729b7e0186.jpg) Join us in the Scholars' Lab Monday morning through Wednesday night next week, as we project the social media landscape surrounding next week's historic presidential inauguration.

We'll be showing real-time [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and [Flickr](http://flickr.com) feeds that record people's responses to the event and their efforts at citizen-journalism. We've also created a home-grown geospatial visualization so that you can follow the worldwide conversation!

Visit the Lab for a little social interaction of your own, or [access the site](http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/inauguration/) (which includes more information and related links) online.
