![Jean Bauer photography](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3064/2961963222_3fa2a2e441_m.jpg)A bright, sunny, open space like the Scholars' Lab begs to be filled  not only with students and faculty collaborating on digital projects, but also with art!  We're pleased to follow last semester's successful showing of the watercolors of E. F. Chilton with this semester's photography exhibit by our own [Jean Bauer](http://jeanbauer.com/).

Jean is a Ph.D. candidate in the History department at UVA and a 2008-2009 Fellow in Digital Humanities at the Scholars' Lab. Â Her exhibit, entitled "Animal, Vegetable, Mineral: Slices of the (Mostly) Natural World", is on display in the Lab right now.
