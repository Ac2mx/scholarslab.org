My interests include text processing, text mining, and natural language processing, as well as web-development and general programming.

Studied medieval English literature and linguistics at [UGA](http://www.english.uga.edu/). Dissertated on lexicography. Now I program in Haskell and write when I'm not building cool stuff for the Scholars' Lab. Also, husband and parent. Do you notice that _sleep_ isn't on that list?
