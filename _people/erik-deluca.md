Erik DeLuca makes music that moves from being influenced by 90's rock and the New York School of composers, to listening in quiet places. His dissertation, "Fieldworks: a Path to Composing" entwines the boundaries of acoustic ecology, audio documentary, anthropology, and electroacoustic music composition. In 2013 "Winter"—a piece for orchestra, voice, and recordings of silence—premiered in Denali National Park by the Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival Orchestra and "Community Listening in Isle Royale National Park", a multi-media sonic ethnography, was featured on a panel at the Society for Ethnomusicology Conference. Erik is a PhD candidate in the Music Department at UVa.
