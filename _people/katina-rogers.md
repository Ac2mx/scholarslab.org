Katina was formerly the Scholarly Communication Institute's Senior Research Specialist. She worked to share outcomes from conversations SCI convened on emerging models for authoring and publication and on graduate education reform. She also surveyed humanities-trained respondents who self-identified as working in alternative academic careers, and played a role in the expansion of the Praxis Program to a multi-institutional and international effort.
