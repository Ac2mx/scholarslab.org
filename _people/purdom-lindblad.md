The Scholars' Lab fosters a vibrant [graduate community](/people), rich with alumni, current fellows, student assistants, and fellow travelers. As the Head of Graduate Programs, I coordinate our two [fellowship programs](/student-opportunities), the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities and our innovative [Praxis Program](http://www.praxis.scholarslab.org). In addition, I work with the international [Praxis Network](http://www.praxis-network.org), which showcases new models of humanities methods training.

I have a background in Religious Studies, American Studies, and Information Science. Currently, I am exploring [Ivanhoe](http://www.ivanhoe.scholarslab.org) and our new MakerSpace, with a special focus on wearable computing.
