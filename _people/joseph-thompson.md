Joseph Thompson is a doctoral candidate in the Corcoran Department of History. His dissertation, "Sounding Southern: Music, Militarism, and the Making of the Sunbelt," uses music to examine the cultural impact of the military-industrial complex since the 1950s. This analysis draws on methods ofÂ cultural history, political history, and sound studies to consider the shifting meanings of race, region, and citizenship over the last half of the twentieth century.
