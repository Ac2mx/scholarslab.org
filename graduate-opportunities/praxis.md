**Applications are due February 15th, 2018 for the 2018-2019 cohort**. Please [subscribe](https://eepurl.com/fJ9J) to the Scholars' Lab newsletter or check back here for further information.

The [Praxis Program](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/) is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars' Lab. Its fellowships support a team of six University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars' Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year.

Our first two cohorts designed and built [Prism](http://prism.scholarslab.org/), a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined [Ivanhoe](http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/), a WordPress theme enabling collaborative criticism through roleplay. Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project [Clockwork](http://clockwork.scholarslab.org/). Stay tuned for news about our incoming cohort!

Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library's [Scholarly Communication Institute](http://uvasci.org), the Praxis Program is now generously supported by [UVa Library](http://www.library.virginia.edu/) and [GSAS](http://gsas.virginia.edu/).

The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients' teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote 10 hours per week in the Scholars' Lab. A call for applicants will be announced in January 2017.

### Eligibility

Applicants must be doctoral students in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.

Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.

Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held.

### How to Apply

The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent. The letter should include:

* the applicant's research interests;
* summary of the applicant's plan for use of digital technologies in your research;
* summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
* summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow;
* and your availability February 28th from 11:30 -12:30 and March 1st from 9:30-10:30. We're aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those group interview times in advance, though they may be subject to change if scheduling difficulties arise.

Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh.
