One of our primary missions is to support the work of emerging scholars and digital humanities practitioners--particularly UVa graduate students. In addition to our general consultations (grad students are invited to [write us](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) for an appointment any time!), we offer two graduate fellowship programs that provide students with the time, space, and mentorship necessary to discover, explore, and build.








## Digital Humanities Fellows


We are now accepting applications for the 2017-2018 Praxis Cohort. Please visit [http://tinyurl.com/SLabDHFellows17-18](http://tinyurl.com/SLabDHFellows17-18) for complete information. 

Applications are due **Tuesday, February 28**.

The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports ABD graduate students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development.

Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per semester.

Supported by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund, and a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.

Fellows receive a $10,000 award split in two payments over the 12-month fellowship year. Occasional "digital scholarship awards" in a lesser amount, or extended fellowships, may be awarded to worthy projects at the discretion of the committee. See past fellowship winners [on our People page](http://scholarslab.org/people/). The call for applicants is issued annually, in March.

## Praxis Program Fellowships


We are now accepting applications for the 2017-2018 Praxis Cohort. Please visit [http://tinyurl.com/SLabPraxis17-18](http://tinyurl.com/SLabPraxis17-18) for complete information. 

Applications are due **Tuesday, February 28**.

The [Praxis Program](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/) is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars' Lab. Its fellowships support a team of six University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars' Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year.

Our first two cohorts designed and built [Prism](http://prism.scholarslab.org/), a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined [Ivanhoe](http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/), a WordPress theme enabling collaborative criticism through roleplay. Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project [Clockwork](http://clockwork.scholarslab.org/). Stay tuned for news about our incoming cohort!

Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library's [Scholarly Communication Institute](http://uvasci.org), the Praxis Program is now generously supported by [UVa Library](http://www.library.virginia.edu/) and [GSAS](http://gsas.virginia.edu/).

The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients' teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote 10 hours per week in the Scholars' Lab. A call for applicants will be announced in January 2017.


### Eligibility


Applicants must be doctoral students in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.

Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.


### How to Apply


The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent. The letter should include:



 	
  * the applicant's research interests;

 	
  * summary of the applicant's plan for use of digital technologies in your research;

 	
  * summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program

 	
  * summary of what the applicant hope to gain as a Praxis Fellow
