*Issues for GitHub that I keep being too lazy to submit in the moment, if discovered when have good flow going.*

- Person: 'posts by blah' farther to left than edge of flexbox content but when tried wrapping w/ same thing it made everything tiny so gotta investigate further on that

- Person: button on bottom needs margin-bottom and also prob to be for seeing the rest of someone's posts if they exist rather than taking to all people page. Will also need Liquid logic that only displays this button if someone has more than 3 posts.
