# Workflow: Miscellanea

Mostly Katherine's notes to self.

## Content:

*(Slightly outdated.)*

### Okay so, what do you want to accomplish:

* Make it easier for people to all submit content to same place
* Identify within the HTML document what that content is
* Ability for people to see that HTML document easily
	* Aka, not hidden within non-Jekyllized folder

### How to make that happen:

* Write instructions on how to find the document
* Appropriately mark up (a copy of) the ```index.html``` file and see how that goes
* Possibly mark each section w/ people's names? It just needs to *not* have CSS in it tbh, so we only focus on the content.

## Colors:

- Black
- Magenta: ```rgba(255,1,254,1)```
- Cyan: ```rgba(0,255,255,1)```
- Majorelle Blue: ```rgba(0,47,255,1)```

(Magenta is slightly off because that's apparently what I've been using in Adobe Draw and I'mma be all superstitious about it. Also definitely is not actual Majorelle Blue, but not letting myself get down a rabbit hole of looking up those values and deciding whether it's better than what I'm using!)
