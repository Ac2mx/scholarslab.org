# Content Flow Repo

## Okay so, what do you want to accomplish:

* Make it easier for people to all submit content to same place
* Identify within the HTML document what that content is
* Ability for people to see that HTML document easily
	* Aka, not hidden within non-Jekyllized folder

## How to make that happen:

* Write instructions on how to find the document
* Appropriately mark up (a copy of) the ```index.html``` file and see how that goes
* Possibly mark each section w/ people's names? It just needs to *not* have CSS in it tbh, so we only focus on the content.

## Also, while we're here:

* Make branch off ```master``` to incorporate your formatting changes from very beginning of ```kbd-theme``` branch
	* The formatting differences are what caused the merge conflict today, and it's something you meant to mention to people anyway
* Ensure is okay to rename files and such and submit for pull request
