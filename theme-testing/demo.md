# Thoughts:

This site doesn't look likee what we associate "Scholarly" websites to be.

## From your talk in the spring

## Part I: Overview

### 1. Social movements use peer-to-peer contact as a primary mode of spreading ideas/empathy
- Who gets a bunch of their information from Twitter?

### 2. I'm making the assumption that those of us working on social justice/equity projects want people to see them. Digital humanities projects working on subjects that address social or cultural injustice have an immplicit goal of getting people to educate themselves about the issue.
- Education and engagement are prerequisites for mass empathy
- Mass empathy is how social change happens
- Direct link sharing between people who trust one another's subject expertise is increasingly the way that people learn details about a subject

### 3. I think this contrasts a lot with how we think/talk about the websites we actually put up
- Subtle blues, Calibri font, non-objectionable, "respectable" design
- (A small example: the inevitable request for sources or further reading in an informative Twitter thread about a systemic injustice that a large part of the audience didn't have any idea about. It's both to verify, and to genuinely explore further.)
- We tend to put up websites that accidentally or implicitly assume that the primary readership will be academic, or people already heavily involved in the subject

### 4. It is not shameful for engaging design to be our explicit goal; education is the only path towards mass empathy, and peer-to-peer spreading is how a lot of information is passed these days. 
- There's a squeamishness around talking about design as intentional choices, rather than something that just *happens* in the process of publishing this knowledge (archive, interactive study, etc.).

### 5. It's not inherently moral to look past the boring or unclear design of an academically-oriented website; and it is not inherently amoral to prefer websites that look nice to the human eye.
### 6. Where this comes together, is the part I've been thinking a lot about. Design, at its core, does the heavy lifting between people loading a page and the point where that page's information speaks for itself.
- It keeps people - potential learners and advocates and allies - on the page until intellectually/cognitively engaged with the content itself.
- We must remember: *unless someone already knows a ton about a given subject, the desire to stay on a page will not be immediate or inherent.*

### 7. We must, as DH practitioners, embrace this moving forward, and recognize that visually appealing design is a vital part of the larger quest for human equity.


## Goals

"Community for experimental scholarship"

- We are not serious or boring. We do serious work, but it's important that the site reflect the off-kilter vibe we offer and are proud of.

### Info design

- Biggest goal is to be more inviting to people we may have missed before because they haven't been historically welcome in technical spaces

- The other goal is findability of what people actually want, both site-wide and at a glance
  - E.g. site map page, more than one path to view important links
  - eyebrow labels on blog posts to work with how people **actually** scan pages

- No shame in pure aesthetic appeal
	- Aesthetics do the heavy lifting for important content
	- It's an implicit signal that you can trust us to put in the effort on the weird or experimental
	- A business suit is shorthand for credibility and trust in certain environments
	- A website is shorthand for what we are, why you might be interested&mdash;the site's design gets across what the text simply can't.

- Re. implicit signal: I want non-traditional participants to look at our site and go "oh&mdashthey *get it*."
	- Instead of being dismissed out of hand as unscholarly, or unserious, or frivolous
	- This is another site at which intersectionality operates
	- Anything concerning non-white men has historically suffered by the hand of ensuring respectability

- Colors: lots of our content is text-based and bright accent colors add a way to keep visual attention
	- Teal and purple are bright, fun, and non-gendered

- More info design:
	- Emphasize, repeatedly and specifically, what one can expect and that they *are* welcome here
	- Corporate language is incredibly adept at inclusive lip service, so we must give people a reason to believe there's truth in those words - one's logical heuristic wouldn't allow that with words alone

- Future goals
	- Identify a point person as often as possible -> less intimidating than contacting whole listserv
	- Identify helpful subcategories where relevant (e.g. makerspace and spatial tech inventory subsections)
	- Resources for familiarizing oneself with a given topic ahead of time

### More minor but still important

- In humanities, you're presumably putting your best people on each aspect of public presentation at which they excel
- you can see this in the care we take w/ our writing, the photos we use - thus, one would assume the same for the actual web design of the site
- In turn, we are a Lab - a place for shcolars to experiment. In web design, that means exploring the mutual bounds of the cutting edge of whwat people will soon grow used to seeing, but *without* sacrificing functionality or empathy.
